short-title: 2. Using haskell-flake
---

# Simplify Haskell Nix configuration using haskell-flake

>[!warning] TODO: Write this! 
> For now, see the code: https://github.com/juspay/todo-app/pull/16

Things to highlight:

- haskell-flake reduces a bunch of lines to pretty much 1
- whilst still allowing all the things you can do with raw nixpkgs infra
- it can also support other package sets, like horizon
- example projects (since todo-app has empty configuration)
