[Juspay] is looking to add a 3rd member to our Nix team. The position is **full-time and remote**.

The role primarily involves nixifying our internal projects - which are written mostly in Haskell, but also Rust, PureScript, ReScript, Python and several other languages and tools. We use [flake-parts](https://community.flake.parts/) wherever possible to provide a simpler Developer Experience. To get a sense of what you will mostly be working on, see the Nix in [nammayatri]. The role can potentially involve some Rust work as well. Contributing to Open Source is encouraged; you may view **our Open Source Nix projects** [on GitHub][oss].

The ideal candidate is:

- Motivated about writing Nix
- Cares about improving Developer Experience
- Communicates clearly & writes good documentation[^this]

To apply, send the Nix contributions you are most proud of (along with your résumé) by [email](mailto:sridhar.ratnakumar@juspay.in) or [X DM](https://x.com/sridca).
